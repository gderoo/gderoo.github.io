                            <p>Labeled images were taken from the GTI and the KITTI vision benchmark suite. All images are 64x64 pixels. A third data set released by Udacity was not used here. In total there are 8792 images of vehicles and 8968 images of non vehicles, so only a slight imbalance. An example can be seen below</p>

                            <li> Calculate color histogram with 32 bins by HLS channel</li>
                            <li> Calculate Histogram Oriented Graph (HOG) for each color channel</li>
                            </ul>
                            The result can be partially seen below for a car and non car.

                            <p>We trained a linear SVM, and nothing more complex, since we already reached an 99% accuracy on the test set. To reach this performance
                            <ul>
                                <li>Features were scaled across training images</li>
                                <li>We used a GridSearch on the C parameter, with an locally optimal value found for 0.01</li>
                            </ul>
                            Here are some example of predictions</p>

                            <p><b>Sliding Window Search</b></p>
                            
                            <p>We used a series of windows that would follow a perspective effect because smaller cars should only be further on the horizon. In addition to this, we decided to put some randomness in the x and y origins in order to help smooth the behaviors of the detector. For each window the image then goes through the following step:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Content of each window is the rescaled to (64,64)</li>
                                <li>Features and extracted, and SVM used to predict if there is a car</li>
                                <li>For each window with a car, +1 is added to a blank image, creating a heat map</li>
                                <li>The heat goes through a proces of thresholding, smoothing, and labelling using `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()`</li>
                            The result can be seen below</p>

                            <p>There are a couple of issues we can be seen already or anticipated:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Risk associated to generalization of different luminosity context, etc </li>
                                <li>Instability of window despite the smoothing and randomization techniques</li>
                                <li>Computing speed is low</li>
                            </ul>
                            Potential improvements for the computing spee could be:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Drop some of the 6108 features (since we start from 64*64 = 4,096 some are probably redundant)</li>
                                <li>Implement a faster HOG calculation strategy in which the HOG is calculated once for the image (i.e. not by window)</li>
                                <li>Use a class system for each object and implement more smoothing technique on boxes</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
