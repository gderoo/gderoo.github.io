                            <p>This is an overview of a group project done for the Berkeley class on Data Visualization. </p>
                            <p>The purpose was to build a dashboard for remote operators of Battery Storage Power Stations, which are usually deployed as small, distributed and unmanned facilities.</p>
                            <p>The visualization was developed using mostly D3 and a time series database backed back-end (influxDB). The data presented is obfuscated but real power generators data.</p>

                            Given that an operator can have multiple sites to monitor, we wanted to give the user the ability to quickly be taken to a node if he knows its name

                            <p><b><i>Tree:</i></b></br>
                            Since batteries are physically organized in a tree like fashion through electric connections, we wanted to keep this structure: if a battery is heating up, neighboring batteries may too, for instance.</br>
                            We use elements that people may expect: ability to select, collapse, get summary statistics by hovering.</br>
                            Here of course, the number of nodes is only a sample.
                            </p>

                            Remote operators have a backlog of notifications to address. We used a type of common to users: a notification center of the same type as the MacOS interface. </br>
                            Operator can mark notifications (Dismiss/Resove/Escalate), and have associated editing tools (Undo/Redo/Share/Save). Since the focus was on visualization, we did only placed function placeholders.</br>
                            We also intended to allow users to recall past notifications (not only current ones), hence the Live switch.

                                <li>Preprocessing could also include noise, or the introduction of deformation (e.g. some photographs are not taken purely perpendicularly)</li>
                                <li>In its current implementation, histogram equalization for RGB images may also be distorting the color balance, so adding images with different brightness may achieve better results</li>
