                            <p>This is an overview of a group project done for the Berkeley class on Data Visualization. </p>
                            <p>The purpose was to build a dashboard for remote operators of Battery Storage Power Stations, which are usually deployed as small, distributed and unmanned facilities.</p>
                            <p>The visualization was developed using mostly D3 and a time series database backed back-end (influxDB). The data presented is obfuscated but real power generators data.</p>

                            Given that an operator can have multiple sites to monitor, we wanted to give the user the ability to quickly be taken to a node if he knows its name
                            </p>

                            <p><b><i>Tree:</i></b></br>
                            Batteries are physically organized in a tree like fashion through electric connections, so we wanted to keep this structure: if a battery is heating up, neighboring batteries may too, for instance.</br>
                            We enabled functionalities that people may expect in trees: ability to select, collapse, get summary statistics by hovering, etc.</br>
                            Here of course, the number of nodes is only a sample.
                            </p>

                            <p><b><i>Notification Center:</i></b></br>
                            As notifications appear, we wanted to give remote operators a place with the backlog of notifications to address. We used a visualization common to users: a notification center similar to the MacOS interface. </br>
                            Operator can interact with notifications (Dismiss/Resolve/Escalate), and have associated editing tools (Undo/Redo/Share/Save). Since the focus was on visualization, we did only placed function placeholders.</br>
                            We also intended to allow users to recall past notifications (not only current ones), hence the Live switch shown on the right.
                            </p>

                            <p><b><i>Graph:</i></b></br>
                            To investigate notifications, and make a decision on the best action, operators want to drill down on the some metrics of the node at stake.</br>
                            We put the table of metrics and the graph of the selected metrics side by side to keep the dashboard in one page. And enabled zoom and brush functionality so that the operator can get into the detailed without losing the context (shown in the smaller graph below).
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Further improvements</b></p>
                            <p> During user test exposed a series of limitations, summarized in the MoSCoW matrix below. Some were addressed, but I would highlight the 2 following suggestions:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Metric tables:</b> Number of metrics can be overwhelming without clear organizing principle. Color coding the metrics (type or link with alarm) or changing the layout could reduce that issue</li>
                                <li><b>Metric graphs:</b> User had a hard time reading exact values, and were unfamiliar with the brush and zoom functionalities. Although we solved that issue with a tooltip (implemented in top left graphs), we could also move to a more common visualization, such as that used by Google for stocks</li>
                                <li><b>Tree:</b> Users found the interface engaging, but not very stable. In future, the representation should be able to deal with more, and clearer organization (e.g. node 1 close to node 2)</li>
                            </ul></p>
